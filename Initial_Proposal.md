It is our intention to design a mobile application using Java in Android Studio. Users can refer to this application for information about best practices to prevent accidents, and will feature a step-by-step guide to ensure that users collect all pertinent information should they find themselves to be in an accident. 

### Defining the Problem

Auto accidents are unfortunately a fairly common occurrence due to the high volume of vehicles on the road. In 2018, the estimated number of accidents in Nassau County was 40,300 and 36,000 for Suffolk County. Although this occurs frequently, it can be difficult to remember all of the steps and what information should be collected at the time of an accident. These are stressful situations and carry the risk of injury as well. 

One of our main objectives is to make a stressful process easier. Our ASAP app will guide you through a step-by-step process of what to do should you find yourself in an accident. It will provide the tools needed to make an insurance claim, exchange information, document damage, and will inform the user so that they can be more prepared in the future.

The community that will benefit from this mobile application would be anyone who drives a vehicle (users aged 16 or older). We intend to develop this application for Android phones only, as we believe that this will reach a substantial number of our target users.

### Four Week Plan

For the first week, we are going to concentrate on doing the initial design and finishing a low-fidelity prototype. Then, we will evaluate the prototypes out of the ones we made and choose the one that fits best. Next, we will come to a consensus on all of the working pieces of the prototype, agree on how things will function, and finalize it. Once we do that, we can begin our next phase which is role assignment.

For the second week, we will take another look at our final design and begin choosing roles for developing the functions of the application. Once roles are assigned, we will begin some initial coding during meetings to have a base to work off of. After that, we will have members work on their assigned parts of the application. We will have meetings within the week to check on progress and put everything together.

For the third week, we will work towards developing a high-fidelity prototype. We will make sure we are making good progress on the main menu, the step-by-step process, and other main functions of the application like the camera, profile, database system, and the report.

For the fourth week, we will work on finishing all the main functionalities so we can have a working high-fidelity prototype for the presentation. Once all coding is done for those parts, we will work on making the presentation. We will make sure everyone's speaking parts are accounted for and how it will be presented so we can be prepared for presentation day.
